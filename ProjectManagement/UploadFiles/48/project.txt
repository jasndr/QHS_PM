Over the years, young adolescents have increased their interest in this field based on the fact that there are over 14.3 million jobs available; some of which offer the best employment opportunities in the economy. Unfortunately, out of the dozens of different healthcare occupations, a majority of the public is familiar with only a few, such as nurse, doctor, and physical therapist, This lack of knowledge and preparation hinders high school students' opportunity to pursue a long-term career that compliments their personal interests. Therefore I have a proposal for my Senior Project to present 5 out of the many unknown medical careers at an event that will take place at Mililani High School. These 5 careers are biostatician, surgical technologist, cytotechnologist, orthoptist, and child-life specialist.

","Summary  Substantial over diagnosis and mistreatment of malaria in Cameroon is evident (Mangham et al., 2011; Chandler et al., 2012). Clinicians continue to prescribe malaria drugs even when the blood smear results are negative. Health workers are finding it difficult to change this practice. Malaria microscopy capacity is still very low in most parts of the country and this has worsened matters. Curiously, in settings with expert microscopists, the consulting health worker does not accept negative microscopy results in the presence of symptomatic fever (Chandler et al., 2012). The reason for this is that symptoms of malaria are not specific to one disease and clinicians may have a lack of confidence in the accuracy of diagnosis (Chandler et al., 2012). Clinicians fear missing a case of malaria and this leads to an emphasis on malaria above other diseases for patients presenting with fever. This finding is not unexpected because malaria is more endemic to Cameroon than other febrile illnesses.    Many febrile patients in Cameroon are assumed to have malaria and remain without a diagnosis even if they fail to respond to antimalarial drugs. Under the prevailing practices, there is a real potential of misdiagnosis of Flaviviruses as well as other pathogens. In the first ever seroprevalence study of Arboviruses conducted in Cameroon, a high prevalence of Flaviviruses was recorded (Fokam et al., 2010). Thus Flaviviruses could be a potential cause for over diagnosis of malaria in Cameroon. As the prevalence of malaria decreases, more patients have non-malarial causes of fever. It will be important to know what causes these fever episodes so as to better treat cases.  Therefore, the goal / purpose of this study is to determine how frequently malaria is over-diagnosed and what other infections are being missed.

Frail nursing home patients are at high risk for hospitalization.  The purpose of this study was to examine baseline prevalent chronic diseases associated with hospital readmission within 30 days.    Methods: We collected data on demographics and prevalent diseases for all patients admitted to one hospital-affiliated nursing home between January 2003 and December 2006, with follow-up data on pneumonia episodes and hospitalizations through June 2011.  Multivariable logistic regression models identified baseline prevalent chronic diseases associated with hospital readmission within 30 days of nursing home admission.    Results: Of 238 patients (mean age 83.4, range 45-103) admitted to the nursing home, 156 (65.5%) originally came from hospitals, 54.6% were female, 92.4% were Asian, 43.6% were on Medicaid, and 76.5% were first admitted for intermediate care and 23.5% for skilled nursing care.  Although recent pneumonia was the factor most strongly associated with hospital readmission (OR=14.5, p<0.0001), in the model without pneumonia, chronic diseases associated with 30-day hospital readmission included pulmonary disease (OR=2.2, 95%CI=1.1-4.3, p=0.019) and congestive heart failure (OR=1.8, 95%CI=1.0-3.4, p=0.055).  There were no significant associations between hospital readmission and myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and dementia.    Conclusions: Among nursing home patients, although recent pneumonia was the strongest risk factor for 30-day hospital readmission, those with baseline chronic pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure were at especially high risk for hospital readmission within 30 days of nursing home admission.  These patients may benefit from care focused on preventing hospital readmissions.

Based on self-report data there seems to be this phenomena of generalized anger of an explosive form as a result of personally accumulated and vicariously experienced situations of perceived indignities/ suffering from the period of colonialism/annexation to current. I believe that this historic memory-if you will-is a mediating variable of explosive anger and that it is a significant contributing factor to crime, self-medicating substance abuse. I would like to confine my research to the Waianae Coast where I have access to three treatment centers from which to draw samples. The variation of factors that would effect/influence  multi-generational anger would be ethnicity/race, income, education, and pervasiveness of multi-generational anger. I am planning on constructing a questionnaire that would capture the multi-generational anger construct, and might need help with this. I have several research questions but need help properly formulating hypotheses, data analysis plan and power analysis for the proposed research project/design.

As a result, inflammation and pathology occur, increasing the risk of spontaneous abortions, premature deliveries, and low birth weight babies. Fortunately, antibodies (Ab) against VAR2CSA significantly improve pregnancy outcomes. VAR2CSA-based vaccines are being designed with the goal of inducing high levels of protective Ab, and safety testing of one candidate vaccine will begin in humans this year. However, there is no method for determining if a woman is immune to placental malaria (PM). The availability of a cost-effective diagnostic approach that identifies a woman's level of immunity will allow 1) doctors to provide better prenatal care, 2) vaccine developers to assess the level of immunity women have before and after vaccination, and 3) government officials to make intelligent health policies for pregnant women, especially with the changing malaria landscape due to implementation of intervention strategies. Therefore, our goal is to use a combination of serological and functional assays to characterize Ab that mediate clearance of IE from the placenta and then use the data to develop statistical models that predict whether a woman has sufficient immunity to 1) prevent placental pathology and 2) prevent PM. Archival samples from pregnant Cameroonian women with different levels of immunity to PM will be screened in assays that measure different characteristics of Ab to VAR2CSA, including specificity, avidity, and function. This part of the study is straight-forward as the assays are already optimized in our laboratory. In addition, we seek to develop two new functional assays that measure the ability of Ab to (a) block the interaction of VAR2CSA with CSA and (b) prevent activation and dysregulation of placental trophoblasts exposed to IE, a mechanism that contributes to placental pathology. Results from the serological and functional assays will help identify characteristics of protective Ab. Then, the data will be used to build multi-assay statistical prediction models. Two statistical approaches will be used. First, multivariable logistic models will be built based on a combination of Ab characteristics and other key variables related to immunity (e.g., age, gravidity, hematocrit, length of gestation). This approach will result in two 'user friendly' simple risk indexes (formulas) based on the least number of assays and variables that provide the optimal prediction for prevention of pathology and infection. Second, a recursive partitioning approach will be taken to develop classification and regression trees (CART) and random forests (RF) using the data. The resulting binary classification trees will be easy to interpret and allow more complex immunological pathways to be incorporated. Once the models are developed, data from archival samples collected monthly throughout pregnancy will be used to determine when during pregnancy the models have the best predictive value in high and low malaria transmission settings.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,,2013-07-16,,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,,,2013-06-15,,2013-07-15,0,0,1,31,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Infectious disease",5,"Cameroonian women",2,0,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,3,5,0,8,,0,2

Although filoviruses (Ebolavirus (EBOV) and Marburgvirus (MARV)) are endemic only to certain parts of central Africa and the Philippines, their extreme virulence and potential for weaponization have lead to the determination that both are high priority biothreats to US national security. Consequently, filovirus medical  countermeasures have been prioritized for acquisition into the Strategic National Stockpile. While strategies for passive immunotherapy have made significant progress in the past two years, vaccination remains the most economical and technically feasible approach to protect larger groups of people from the threat of acquiring  these viral diseases. Development of other vaccine candidates is slow due to issues with production, stability, safety, and efficacy in humans. Therefore, a continuing need exists to develop alternate filovirus vaccines that meet stockpiling requirements.    The overall goal of this project is to further develop a multivalent, non-replicating recombinant subunit  filovirus vaccine that can protect civilian and military populations against infection by all pathogenic strains of EBOV and MARV. This vaccine is based on highly purified recombinant filovirus subunit proteins expressed from stably transformed Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells. A key advantage of this production system is the ability to consistently produce large quantities of pure, stable, and properly folded viral proteins. Immunoaffinity chromatography is key for the highly efficient production and is being facilitated by the use of plant-expressed monoclonal antibodies. Unlike other vaccine technologies, the recombinant subunit approach permits inclusion of antigens from diverse pathogens to achieve truly broad spectrum efficacy. Fine tuning of antigen dosing,  immunization schedule, and adjuvant selection allow the rapid inclusion of new or modified targets into a core vaccine formulation. This core formulation will be further defined during the proposed work. The unique advantages of our platform are initially targeted at demonstrating feasibility in a candidate with protection against three filoviruses, having a safety profile only achievable with the use of highly purified subunit proteins.    This research is divided into three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, the ideal adjuvant for the ZEBOV lead vaccine  formulation will be selected to optimize the efficacy profile. Subsequently the minimal number of ZEBOV antigens required for full efficacy in primates will be determined, followed by evaluation of durability. Aim 2 is focused on achieving efficacy against three filoviruses in one formulation. Initial antigen balancing will be conducted in mice, then guinea pig challenge models of ZEBOV and MARV will be used to evaluate multivalent efficacy. The final candidate will then be tested for efficacy against ZEBOV, SEBOV and MARV in nonhuman  primate models. Aim 3 is focused on antigen production methods development using plant-expressed antibodies for purification, and will generate well-characterized pilot antigen lots.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,,2013-07-02,,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,,,2013-06-21,,2013-07-02,0,0,1,12,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Virology,6,,3,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,3,5,0,8,,0,2

Additional outcomes include describing satisfaction, expulsion, bleeding patterns, and breastfeeding rates as well as assessing attrition rates and feasibility of a larger study. This will be a prospective study in pregnant teens aged 14 to 19 years who plan to use LNG IUS for postpartum contraception. Thirty participants will be enrolled during prenatal visits then randomized after admission to labor & delivery. They will be randomized into equal groups to insertion of LNG IUS 1) within 10 minutes after delivery of the placenta (immediate post placental) or 2) four to six weeks postpartum (delayed interval). Follow up visits will occur at four to six weeks, ten to twelve weeks, and six months.

In Hawaii, 70% of women (unknown HIV sero-status) were found to be HPV-infected which is similar to global statistics where up to 70% of men and women are HPV-infected including those who are HIV-seropositive. Statistics on men infected with HPV in Hawaii are not known. There are two HPV types (16 & 18) which are associated with 60-70% of anal cancer and anal squamous intraepithelial lesions but how HIV infection increases the risk for developing anal cancer/dysplasia remains unclear and the significance of both HPV and HIV in the anal canal is also unknown. These issues as well as addressing the stigma of screening for anal cancer/dysplasia are the focus of the project. Screening for anal dysplasia/cancer is a multi-step process. Patients are first screened by an anal Pap test and if positive, then a high resolution anoscopy (HRA) procedure is performed. The anal Pap cytology is only a screening tool to determine if patients need to be referred for an HRA which is the diagnostic test by obtaining biopsies. However, it is not practical nor cost-effective for every patient to undergo HRA. Thus, is there a better screening paradigm to identify who needs HRA? Patients in Hawaii face two challenges dealing with anal cancer/dysplasia screening. The HIV stigma and having an anal Pap performed in a clinic deters patients from  anal Pap screening as part of their routine healthcare. Second, anal Pap tests are only for screening therefore all patients with positive results have HRA performed but it turns out that about 25-40% may not have needed the HRA. The project's significance lies in using a unique anal Pap tool (self-obtained anal Pap, SOAP-kit) to be used at home which may decrease patient anxiety; and assessing HIV/HPV DNA as biomarkers to determine if they can identify patients who do not need HRA. The project builds upon a new area of HIV and cancer research in Hawaii that will benefit patients through the unique infrastructure. The Specific Aims are: 1) To determine if anal Pap HPV and HIV DNA are unique biomarkers that can identify patients who require high resolution anoscopy (HRA); and 2) To assess the utility of anal Pap self-obtained specimens using a home-kit (self-obtained anal Pap, SOAP-kit). The study is innovative in its use of the SOAP-kit for patients to obtain anal Pap specimens at home and to determine if biomarkers can be used in the decision-making process to determine who needs HRA for the definitive anal dysplasia/cancer diagnosis. The study team is a unique collaboration of investigators from JABSOM, School of Social Work, and the Cancer Center to benefit patients in Hawaii.

For condition W2, from figure 2 it seems that there was ~ 23% +/- 20% increase in venom discharge after washing with saline (W3).     What would be the p value in a comparison of W4 69% +/- 32% with a value of 23% +/- 20% for W3>     Pg 31 states 'Statistical analyses (one-way ANOVA) were performed on these percentages (transformed by arcsin square-root to normalise the distribution) to determine if the quantities of venom varied between the different washings. Post hoc analysis (using least-signifi cant difference - LSD) was performed to determine which washings were statistically different to one another.'

(2014)","I am Steve Herman, PhD, a Stanford-trained psychologist, and an associate professor of psychology at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. I also happen to be an older father. I was shocked and worried when I saw one of the hundreds of media reports about the results of D'Onofrio et al. (2014).  I read that my child has a risk of developing bipolar disorder that is 25 times greater than the risk to a child of a younger father, a 13 times greater risk of developing ADHD, and so on.     These risk estimates in seemed unbelievably high. When I read the original report of the study in JAMA Psychiatry article, it became clear that the actual findings of D'Onofrio et al. were much different, and much less alarming, than what was reported in the media. The correct risk numbers are shown above. Note the alarming exaggeration of risks in Dr. D'Onofrio's press release. For example, the study actually found that children of older fathers were at 1.4 times the risk of developing bipolar disorder compared to children of younger fathers, not 25 times the risk! The study also showed that children of older fathers were LESS likely to develop ADHD, not 13 times more likely. In absolute terms, the risks seem even less alarming, for example, according to the study findings, approximately 6 of 1000 children born to younger fathers (aged 20 -24) and 8 of 1000 children born to older fathers (aged 45+) will develop bipolar disorder.     When I discovered that the erroneous statements about risks were direct quotes from a misleading press release put out by the lead author, Dr. D'Onofrio, I became angry, and determined to do something to try to correct these errors. My concern is that the widely disseminated misinformation about the risks associated with paternal age will cause older parents unwarranted worry and guilt (see, for example, this report on the study article by an older father) and may lead offspring of older parents who have mental health or academic problems to unfairly blame their parents. Some older parents may even decide to take actions that could actually harm their children in a misguided effort to try to prevent a problem that their children are at very low risk of developing.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Critical Review",,,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"critical review",,2014-03-27,,2014-03-31,0,0,1,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,5,,2,0,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0,0,0,0,3,,,,"Department of Psychology",,,3,5,0,8,,0,2

As a result, inflammation and pathology occur, increasing the risk of spontaneous abortions, premature deliveries, and low birth weight babies. Fortunately, antibodies (Ab) against VAR2CSA significantly improve pregnancy outcomes. VAR2CSA-based vaccines are being designed with the goal of inducing high levels of protective Ab, and safety testing of one candidate vaccine will begin in humans this year. However, there is no method for determining if a woman is immune to placental malaria (PM). The availability of a cost-effective diagnostic approach that identifies a woman's level of immunity will allow 1) doctors to provide better prenatal care, 2) vaccine developers to assess the level of immunity women have before and after vaccination, and 3) government officials to make intelligent health policies for pregnant women, especially with the changing malaria landscape due to implementation of intervention strategies. Therefore, our goal is to use a combination of serological and functional assays to characterize Ab that mediate clearance of IE from the placenta and then use the data to develop statistical models that predict whether a woman has sufficient immunity to 1) prevent placental pathology and 2) prevent PM. Archival samples from pregnant Cameroonian women with different levels of immunity to PM will be screened in assays that measure different characteristics of Ab to VAR2CSA, including specificity, avidity, and function. This part of the study is straight-forward as the assays are already optimized in our laboratory. In addition, we seek to develop two new functional assays that measure the ability of Ab to (a) block the interaction of VAR2CSA with CSA and (b) prevent activation and dysregulation of placental trophoblasts exposed to IE, a mechanism that contributes to placental pathology. Results from the serological and functional assays will help identify characteristics of protective Ab. Then, the data will be used to build multi-assay statistical prediction models. Two statistical approaches will be used. First, multivariable logistic models will be built based on a combination of Ab characteristics and other key variables related to immunity (e.g., age, gravidity, hematocrit, length of gestation). This approach will result in two 'user friendly' simple risk indexes (formulas) based on the least number of assays and variables that provide the optimal prediction for prevention of pathology and infection. Second, a recursive partitioning approach will be taken to develop classification and regression trees (CART) and random forests (RF) using the data. The resulting binary classification trees will be easy to interpret and allow more complex immunological pathways to be incorporated. Once the models are developed, data from archival samples collected monthly throughout pregnancy will be used to determine when during pregnancy the models have the best predictive value in high and low malaria transmission settings.",1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,,2016-02-28,,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,,2014-05-06,2014-08-19,,0,1,0,,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,R21,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Infectious disease",5,"Cameroonian women",2,0,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,"This is a continue malaria study after R21 was granted on 3/1/2014 to 02/28/2016",,0,5,1,6,106,1,0

A range of research has been published on the utility of birth plans in the labor process ranging from supporting their adoption to concluding that patients with birth plans experience worse obstetrical outcomes [Berg et al, Brown et al, Hadar et al, Kaneshiro et al]. The purpose of our study is to determine whether use of a standardized birth plan increases patient satisfaction with their birth experience. Secondary objectives are to determine how these use of a standardized birth plan affects patients' views of their health care providers, utilization of health care resources and interest in use of birth plans for future pregnancies. We will also review medical records to determine routes of delivery, lengths of labor, use of analgesia/anesthesia, and peripartum complications to determine how such factors influence patients' perceptions of the birth experience, in the presence and absence of standardized birth plans.",0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,,,,2,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"Database Design",,2014-07-02,2014-08-18,,0,1,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Birth plans in the labor process",3,,,1,Kaneshiro,"Bliss ",blissk@hawaii.edu,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,,,2,1,,"Principal Investigator: Jennifer Lum, MD  Sub-Investigator: Jennifer Salcedo, MD, Rosie Monardo, MD",,0,5,1,6,48,1,0

It is typically performed as an outpatient procedure whereby patients are discharged on the same day as their surgery.  Due to the nature of the procedure, however, obtaining optimal pain control in the immediate postoperative period can be a significant challenge.  Intravenous opioids are typically used for pain control but their use can lead to nausea/vomiting and sedation, both of which may lead to a delay in discharge, thus increasing staffing time, hospital resources and costs.   A femoral nerve block (FNB) administered intraoperatively can potentially lead to better pain control post-operatively.  It is our hypothesis that the use of a FNB will lead to less immediate post-operative pain, less opioid use, less nausea/vomiting and a shorter time to discharge.   A study done by Schloss et al. (1) looked at all knee arthroscopies performed by all surgeons at a single institution over a 3-year time frame. They compared the use of a FNB versus a simple intra-articular injection and found for the FNB group had a significant improvement in pain, reduced narcotic use, admission rate (ACL surgery only) and decreased time to discharge. While this study design is similar to our study, there are several significant differences. First, we are evaluating only ACL surgeries. Second, ours is a study of a single fellowship trained surgeon's cases performed with the same surgical technique. The goals of these two studies are similar and if our research can further define the efficacy of a FNB for ACL surgery, then it should be conducted.

In addition, we seek to establish the prevalence of prior workup for osteoporosis in geriatric patients presenting with hip fracture. To achieve these aims, consecutive geriatric patients presenting with hip fracture will be prospectively enrolled upon first consultation by the orthopaedic resident on call at Queen's Medical Center (QMC). The hospitals patient safety and readmission records will subsequently be evaluated to determine the incidence of in-hospital falls and hospital readmission within 30 days for this patient population. A baseline rate for in-hospital falls and readmission will be established with retrospective chart review of the previous two years of geriatric patients presenting and treated for hip fracture by the orthopaedic service at QMC. To achieve our second aim,  the primary care physician for patients enrolled in the prospective arm described above will be contacted by facsimile requesting the timing and the value of the patient's most recent DXA scan and serum vitamin D level. The response to this query will be recorded in a de-identified manner and will serve to establish the baseline prevalence of these tests in the primary care setting locally.
